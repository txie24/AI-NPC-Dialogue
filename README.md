# AI NPC Dialogue System Demo

This project is a demonstration of an AI-driven NPC dialogue system built in Python. It uses a simple Tkinter UI for interaction, leverages the SpeechRecognition library for capturing voice input, and serves as a basis for integrating advanced AI dialogue systems (e.g., GPT) later on.

## Features

- **Voice Input:** Uses the SpeechRecognition library to capture and process spoken user input.
- **Simple UI:** A basic Tkinter interface for interacting with the AI NPC.
- **Modular Design:** Easily integrate with advanced AI models and TTS (text-to-speech) systems in the future.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- [SpeechRecognition]
- [pipwin]
- [PyAudio]
- [elevenlabs]

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Install SpeechRecognition:**
- pip install pipwin
- python -m pip install pyaudio
- pip install SpeechRecognition
- pip install SpeechRecognition playsound requests
- pip install elevenlabs
